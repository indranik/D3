Poverty and Health care coverage
Is there a correlation between poverty rate and health care coverage? In order answer this question, we looked at the poverty rate and health care coverage statistics, state by state, and plotted a chart (index.html) to explore the relationship. Click on the circles, which represent individual states, to find out the percentage of population below the poverty line and percentage of population without health care coverage. With a moderate correlation coefficient of 0.52, one could conclude, that as the poverty rate increases, the percentage of people with no health care also increases. While one may also agrue that such a conclusion based on just two data variables is premature, it nonetheless brings forward a formidable challenge that policy makers and public health advocates have to grapple with.
